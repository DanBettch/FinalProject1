To run Final2.m. Run the function 'Final2'. There will be no required inputs to pull up the figure. From here, make a selection on what you want your line to look like, color and style.
The color options are Red, Blue, Yellow, Green, Black, and Cyan. The style options are X, O, +, *, . and diamonds. 
Once you have made your selection, enter the same number of x points of y points in each dedicated box, and press plot. If you have a different number of points, there will be a modal error stating there is an invalid number of points.
You can either enter in a list seperated by spaces, commas, in brackets, or in brackets with commas. This function allows for all the above. 
If you need to clear your current plot, simply press the reset button, and a new blank plot will appear and both the x and y coordinate boxes will also be empty.
